## Project Background


### Challenge Background


### Project Goals
- :dart: **Develop an algorithm that takes into account the environmental conditions, location, and available infrastructure to predict the potential growth of crops in urban areas. 
- :bar_chart: **Analyze facltors such as sunlight exposure, soil quality, water availability and temperature to determine the most suitable crops for a specific urban farming site.
- :clipboard: **Address the risks associated with urban farming to ensure a successful and sustainable operation. Minimise potential risks related to urban agriculture, social and economic risks, including health risks from wastewater irrigation, trace metal, zoonotic risks, and other health risks.**
- :mega: **By identifying and mitigating these risks, we can suggest solutions to potential urban farmers to create a safe and productive environment for growing crops in urban settings.**

### How to Use This App
1. :point_right: Navigate to the [**Model**](#model) page.
2. :writing_hand: Enter the required input features.
3. :chart_with_upwards_trend: Get prediction for crop and yield for input features.

**Note:** Ensure that all input fields are filled in accurately for the best prediction results.
